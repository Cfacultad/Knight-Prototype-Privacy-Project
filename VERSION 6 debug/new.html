In practice, these privacy settings only reduce the chances of the selectively shared information becoming available to the public.</p>\

                        <p>Even if you handle your privacy settings perfectly, anyone who does see your information on social media can share it with others. Re-posting or making a copy of information is easy. For example, computers and phones can take screenshots: pictures of the images and text on their screens. These screenshots can then be shared with anyone who has Internet access. In other words, once you\'ve shared information online, you\'ll never have complete control over where it goes.</p>\
                        <p>Privacy settings are more effective if the people you share information with know your standards of privacy. Avoiding social media doesn’t guarantee that your friends and family won’t post about you. It\'s important to tell your friends and family what you want to keep private, and ask them how they feel about sharing on social media.</p>\
                        <p>Talking about privacy and adjusting your privacy settings carefully reduces the risk of people finding your private information, but it\'s likely that some information will leak out eventually. A good rule of thumb is to never post anything that you wouldn\'t want a co-worker, neighbor, or family member to see.</p>'
